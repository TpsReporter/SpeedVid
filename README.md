# SpeedVid
Bookmarklet for HTML 5 video (YouTube) speed controls

Quick Start (Chrome):

1. Open Bookmark Manager
2. Add a new bookmark
3. Name it SpeedVid
4. For the URL paste in the entire contents of the file bookMarklet.js
5. Save the bookmark
6. Point you browser at your favorite HTML 5 video website (like YouTube)
7. Open the SpeedVid bookmark
8. Use the Following keys with Ctrl+Shift to manipulate playback:

  - "O" play
  - "P" pause
  - "[" skip back 5 seconds
  - "]" skip ahead 5 seconds
  - "0" reset speed to 1.0x
  - "-" decrease current speed by a factor of 1.1
  - "+" increase current speed by a factor of 1.1
  
Audio tends to crap out below .5x and above 4.0x.
If you don't like JQuery use the noJQ version (you loose the tooltips though).
Tooltips don't work in fullscreen mode currently.
